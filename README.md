# Dharma Command Line Interface
Dharma is a protocol for unsecured, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending built on top of Ethereum smart contracts.  Our first testnet release is the Dharma CLI -- a command line tool that makes it easy to:
1. Access a line of crypto credit from the command line in under 5 minutes.
2. Built bots that auto-invest in a portfolio of loans under hyper-customizable, programmable criteria
